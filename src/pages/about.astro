          I've loved making things for as long as I can remember, and wrote my
          first program when I was 6 years old, just two weeks after my mom
          brought home the brand new Macintosh LC 550 that I taught myself to
          type on.

          The only thing I loved more than computers as a kid was space. When I
          was 8, I climbed the 40-foot oak tree at the back of our yard while
          wearing my older sister's motorcycle helmet, counted down from three,
          and jumped â€” hoping the tree was tall enough that with just a bit of
          momentum I'd be able to get to orbit.

          I spent the next few summers indoors working on a rocket design, while
          I recovered from the multiple surgeries it took to fix my badly broken
          legs. It took nine iterations, but when I was 15 I sent my dad's
          Blackberry into orbit and was able to transmit a photo back down to
          our family computer from space
